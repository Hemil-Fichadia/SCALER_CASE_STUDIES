        and the actual code will be in Game class.

        There will be a start game method in GameController which will have gameStatus as IN_PROGRESS
        at start and game will end when a player wins or no cell to make a move that means either
        the game status is DRAWN.

        Before making a move, first we should check if the cell is empty or not, there are going to
        be some methods like makeMove(), checkWinner() and checkState()
